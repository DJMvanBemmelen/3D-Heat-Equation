# 3D Heat Equation

Authors: Daniel van Bemmelen, Jort Bouma

This repository contains a numerical solver for the 3D Heat equation using the Finite Difference Method for the discretization and the Backwards Euler Method to generate the system of equations. The Conjugate gradient method was then used to solve the system of equations. 

The focus of this project is to learn how to work with object oriented programing in c++ for scientific computing. Therefore al matrix and vector classes where built from scratch, challenging us to write efficient and fool proof code. 

Building this code was part of a course within the master Applied Physics at the Technical University Delft. The head instructor and professor of the course was Dr. M. MÃ¶ller.
